# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_FINANCE_DATA

This financial data project was developed during the POWER BI course by the United Network of Professionals (UNP). It aimed to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) like sales, profits, COGS, discounts, and pricing across countries, segments, time periods, and six product categories using advanced visualization techniques.

The analysis uncovered trends and patterns, highlighting inefficiencies and growth opportunities. Actionable insights were derived to enhance KPI performance, support strategic decision-making, and drive business growth.
